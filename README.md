# Traffic-Signal-Controller_using_Verilog
Course Project (Digital Design)  
Semester VI, May 2021  
Skills: Verilog Programming, Xilinx Vivado  

For the Digital Design course project, we designed a traffic signal controller in Xilinx Vivado using Verilog, complemented by a robust testbench. The controller was tailored for a specific intersection scenario, addressing the dynamics of a busy main street (North-South) and a less frequented side street (East-West).  
  
We defined the green and yellow countdown timers for NS and EW signals, encoded present and future state signals using active highs and lows, then constructed a characteristic table, and performed K-map analysis to formulate the state diagram and Verilog code. This project made me realize the importance of defining proper inputs and constraints before initiating the design process, thorough testing on a comprehensive testbench, and handling corner cases.  
  
By the culmination of this project, I was comfortable working on state machine representations in Verilog and preparing high-quality testbenches.
